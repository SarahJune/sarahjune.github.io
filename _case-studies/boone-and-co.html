    <h3>The Project</h3>
    <p>Boone & Co is a concept for a company that provides campground and outdoor conference registrations, to encourage and facilitate more open-air events. </p>
    <h3>My Role</h3>
    <p>For this project, I drove the ideation for the overall company branding and individual UI design, created prototypes for a sign-up page, a credit card payment screen, and an event landing page, and wrote the copy for each user interface.</p>
    <h3>Research</h3>
    <p>Research for this project involved reviewing similar user experiences for sign-in pages and payment interfaces. For the landing page, I brainstormed what someone who was signing up for a conference would need to know, such as how to prepare and what to expect.</p>

    <figcaption><strong>The Sign-In Interface: </strong>Users needed to be able to log in to their account to view tickets, book campsites, update payment info, and do overall account management. This hypothetical company could provide guided trips or just facilitate the campsite registration for customers, making it easy to get out in the woods. This simple sign-in page directs the customers' attention to their account, or first-time visiters have the option to create a new one.</figcaption>

    <h3>UX Design</h3>
    <p>As I created each prototype, I looked at the structure of a simple sign-in screen, and what conventions I would need to include so that the user would be able to navigate each view. I was able to follow conventions for the basic structure, such as including the option to create an account on the sign-in page, should a user not have an account already. For the payment user interface, I included both the payment information and the cart view, so that users could review their purchase before finalizing payment.</p>

    <figcaption><strong>The Payment Interface: </strong>Once users have selected which campsites or conferences they'd like to attend, they need to enter their credit card information to pay. In this interface, users have all the information in front of them around what they are purchasing, and have the option to edit their selection if they need to adjust the dates or remote the registration all together.</figcaption>

    <h3>Visual Design</h3>
    <p>The visual design was developed out of the theme of the company: inspiring people to be in the outdoors. The color palette included a lot of natural tones, while including a brighter green to use for calls to action, buttons, etc.</p>

    <figcaption><strong>The Event Landing Page: </strong>The landing page, by far the most fun part of this project to brainstorm and design, focused on generating sign-ups for an annual retreat called "The Campout." On this page, I wanted to succintly explain the simplicity of the week-long event, call attention to the registration button, and provide additional details below, via the tabs at the bottom of the screen. With the tabs, customers can access more information about the event and see photos from the previous year.</figcaption>
