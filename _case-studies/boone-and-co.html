    <h3>The Project</h3>
    <p>Boone & Co is a concept for a company that provides campground and remote conference registrations, to encourage and facilitate more group outdoor excersions.</p>
    <h3>My Role</h3>
    <p>For this project, I created prototypes for a sign-up page, a credit card payment screen, and an event landing page. I drove the ideation for the overall company branding and individual UI design, created the design, and wrote the copy for each user interface.</p>
    <h3>The Sign-In Page</h3>
    <p>Users needed to be able to log in to their account to view tickets, book campsites, update payment info, and do overall account management. This hypothetical company could provide guided trips or just facilitate the campsite registration for customers, making it easy to get out in the woods.</p>
    <p>This simple sign-in page directs the customers' attention to their account, or first-time visiters have the option to create a new one.</p>

    <h3>The Credit Card Payment UI</h3>
    <p>Once users have selected which campsites or conferences they'd like to attend, they need to enter their credit card information to pay. In this interface, users have all the information in front of them around what they are purchasing, and have the option to edit their selection if they need to adjust the dates or remote the registration all together.</p>

    <h3>The Landing Page</h3>
    <p>The landing page, by far the most fun part of this project to brainstorm and design, focused on generating sign-ups for an annual retreat called "The Campout." On this page, I wanted to succintly explain the simplicity of the week-long event, call attention to the registration button, and provide additional details below, via the tabs at the bottom of the screen. With the tabs, customers can access more information about the event and see photos from the previous year.</p>
