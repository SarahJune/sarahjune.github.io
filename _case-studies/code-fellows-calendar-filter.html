    <h5>Case Study 2</h5>
    <h2>Filter Redesign</h2>
    <article class="details">
      <div>
        <p><strong>Role:</strong> UX / UI Designer</p>
        <p><strong>Tools:</strong> Photoshop</p>
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> The original filter on Code Fellows’ course calendar sas becoming bloated and inefficient with the ever-expanding course offerings. Code Fellows wanted a streamlined way for prospective and current students to navigate and filter the list of upcoming courses that reduced clicks and was easier to use.</p>

        <p>The original filter on Code Fellows’ course calendar was becoming bloated and inefficient with the everexpanding course offerings. Code Fellows wanted a streamlined way for prospective and current students to navigate and filter the list of upcoming courses that reduced clicks and was easier to use.</p>
        <h5>Goal</h5>
        <p>The filter needed to be simplified so the user only needed approximately three clicks to display only the upcoming courses they wanted to see.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>User Research</h3>
        <h5>Method</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>User interviews with Admissions and Operations teams</li>
            <li>Users observations with these team members to see how they use the filter to navigate to a specific course on the calendar</li>
          </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Insights</h3>
        <h5>Findings</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>The filter took +10 clicks to find specific courses</li>
            <li>New filter options had to be added manually</li>
            <li>Unscheduled courses could still be selected in the filter, displaying an empty page</li>
          </ul>
        <h5>Solutions</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Group courses by level to replace the “experience level” section</li>
            <li>Load page with boxes unchecked, so users select the option for the courses they want to see rather than deselect the options they don’t want to see</li>
            <li>Generate filter options based on what courses were scheduled, so that the filter never included courses that weren’t available and didn’t require manual updating</li>
          </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Prototype</h3>
        <p>Based on user research, I created a prototype of the new filter with the following changes:</p>
        <h5>Additions</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Add “Clear Filters” button</li>
            <li>Group courses by levels</li>
            <li>Hide subfilters when parent filter is unchecked</li>
          </ul>
        <h5>Subtractions</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Remove “Cities” option since courses are now only offered in Seattle</li>
            <li>Move “Experience Level” detail to parent course title</li>
          </ul>
          <figure class="img-center">
            <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/filter-prototype.png">
          </figure>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Launch</h3>
        <figure class="img-right third">
          <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/filter-final.png">
        </figure>
        <p>The new filter is much shorter and cleaner. It is reduced to three categories and shortens the user’s search to just a few clicks.</p>
        <h5>Key Learnings</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Interview and observe several different types of users to identify the different goals users have when using the product</li>
            <li>If possible, discuss constraints and possibilities with developers early to reveal technical solutions that may not have been apparent during the planning phase</li>
          </ul>
