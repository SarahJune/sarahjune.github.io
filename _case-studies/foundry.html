    <h4>The Project</h4>
    <p>Foundry is a concept for a company that provides camp ground and woodland conference registrations, to encourage and facilitate more outdoor excersions. The challenge was to create a sign-up page, a credit card payment screen, and a landing page.   </p>
    <h4>My Role</h4>
    <p>I wrote the copy, established the branding, and designed the prototype for this project.</p>
