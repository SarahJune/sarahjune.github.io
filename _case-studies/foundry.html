    <h4>The Project</h4>
    <p>Foundry is a budgeting platform concept, primarily focused on a mobile app where users can record transactions, manage their spending, and track their saving goals in real time.</p>
    <h4>My Role</h4>
    <p>I created the branding and designed two user interface for this project.</p>
    <h3>Research</h3>
    <p>To research this project, I tested existing budgeting apps, both mobile and web-based. I noticed limited flexibility for customization and a focus more on spending limits, rather than saving goals. The goal of this project was to establish an app concept that would facilitate easier budgeting, add a social aspect, and provide a customizable budget in one place.</p>
