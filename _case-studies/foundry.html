    <h4>The Project</h4>
    <p>Foundry is a concept for a budgeting app where users can record transactions, track spending, and manage saving goals in real time.</p>
    <p>The goal of this project was to create an app concept that would provide a customizable budget, add a social aspect, and track savings goals all in one place.</p>
    <h4>My Role</h4>
    <p>I provided ideation and branding for this project, and produced final designs for a logo, an app icon, and three views.</p>
    <h4>Research</h4>
    <p>To research this project, I tested existing mobile and web-based budgeting apps. I noticed limited flexibility and customization, and discovered that most budgeting apps focus on spending limits more than saving goals.</p>
    <h4>UX Design</h4>
    <p>The initial design for this app concept focused on three main interfaces: the profile, the budgets, and settings.</p>
    <p>Users can navigate between each budget category within the budget view by swiping left or right. This updates the data set without having to navigate out of the view.</p>
    <p>The ability to share goals and budgeting/saving tips on the user's profile was also an important part of the app, to create a sense of community and accountability.</p>

    <h4>Visual Design</h4>
    <p>The visual design focused on a clean user interface with large visuals. Since budgets and savings can be an intimidating area for some people, I focused on a simple layout, with straightforward options in each screen. The user can use the app in a way that meets their needs, whether as a simple ledger or a more robust budgeting tool.</p>
    <p>The primary color, a bold green, brings an association with currency, financial health, and growth. The logo—a wrench that also is positioned to look like the letter <em>F</em>, for Foundry—is a nod to the app being a tool within someone's toolkit towards financial indepence.</p>

    <p><strong>Profile: </strong>Each user has a profile that they can fill out as much or as little as they would like, and they can follow other users to get tips on couponing, saving methods, and more.</p>
    <p><strong>Budget: </strong>The clean layout, large buttons, and clear icons create an unintimidating interface to makes it easy for users to quickly track their spending and see at a glance the funds they have within each budget category.</p>
    <p><strong>Settings: </strong>Users can publish their goals to help with accountability, and control the settings within the app for privacy, notifications, and more.</p>
