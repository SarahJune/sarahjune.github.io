    <h2>Foundry</h2>
    <hr class="hrprimary">
    <h4>The Project</h4>
    <p>Foundry is a budgeting platform concept, primarily focused on a mobile app where users can record transactions, manage their spending, and track their saving goals in real time.</p>
    <h4>My Role</h4>
    <p>I created the branding, logo, and app icon, and designed two user interfaces for this project.</p>
    <h3>Research</h3>
    <p>To research this project, I tested existing budgeting apps, both mobile and web-based. I noticed limited flexibility for customization and a focus more on spending limits, rather than saving goals. The goal of this project was to establish an app concept that would facilitate easier budgeting, add a social aspect, and provide a customizable budget in one place.</p>

    <h3>UX Design</h3>
    <p>The primary user interface in Foundry is the individual goal and budget views. Users can easily navigate between their budgets and goals, and the data sets update as the user scrolls through each option.</p>
    <p>The ability to share goals and budgeting or saving tips was also an important part of the app, to create a sense of community and help users learn ways to stick to their goals.</p>

      <figcaption>Each user has a profile that they can fill out as much or as little as they would like, and they can follow other users to get tips on couponing, saving methods, and more. Users can also share their saving goals to help with accountability, and control the settings within the app for privacy, notifications, and more.</figcaption>

    <h3>Visual Design</h3>
    <p>The visual design focused on keeping a clean user interface with large visuals. Since budgets and savings can be an intimidating area for some people, I focused on keeping the visual design simple, with limited options in each screen. The user can use the app in a way that meets their needs, be it as a simple ledger or as a more robust budgeting tool.</p>
    <p>The green primary color signifies money or financial security, and the wrench in the logo is a nod to the app being a tool within someone's toolkit towards financial indepence.</p>
