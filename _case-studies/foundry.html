    <h3>The Project</h3>
    <p>Foundry is a concept for a budgeting platform, primarily focused on a mobile app where users can record transactions, track spending, and manage saving goals in real time.</p>
    <h3>My Role</h3>
    <p>I provided ideation and branding for this project, and produced final designs for a logo, app icon, and two user interfaces.</p>
    <h3>Research</h3>
    <p>To research this project, I tested existing mobile and web-based budgeting apps. I noticed limited flexibility and customization, and discovered that most apps focus more on spending limits over saving goals. The goal of this project was to establish an app concept that would facilitate easier budgeting, add a social aspect, and provide a customizable budget in one place.</p>

    <h3>UX Design</h3>
    <p>A primary user interface in Foundry is the individual goal and budget views. Users can easily navigate between each budget and goal, with data sets updating on horizontal scroll.</p>
    <p>The ability to share goals and budgeting/saving tips was also an important part of the app, to create a sense of community and accountability.</p>

      <figcaption><strong>The Profile: </strong>Each user has a profile that they can fill out as much or as little as they would like, and they can follow other users to get tips on couponing, saving methods, and more. Users can publish their goals to help with accountability, and control the settings within the app for privacy, notifications, and more.</figcaption>

    <h3>Visual Design</h3>
    <p>The visual design focused on a clean user interface with large visuals. Since budgets and savings can be an intimidating area for some people, I kept the visual design simple, with straightforward options in each screen. The user can use the app in a way that meets their needs, whether as a simple ledger or a more robust budgeting tool.</p>
    <p>The primary color, a bold green, brings an association with currency, financial health, and growth. The wrench in the logo is a nod to the app being a tool within someone's toolkit towards financial indepence.</p>
