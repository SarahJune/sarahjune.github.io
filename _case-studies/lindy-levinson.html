    <h3>The Project</h3>
    <p>Lindylevinson.com is a professional website for the Director of Admissions at an adult education company in Seattle, WA. The client wanted a professional website, where she could highlight her past work experience and feature contact information so that people within and outside of her network could get in touch with her.</p>
    <p><a href="https://lindylevinson.com/" target="_blank">See it live »</a></p>
    <h3>My Role</h3>
    <p>I developed and delivered a website that fits the clients personal asthetic and professional brand for a cohesive online presence that represents both her personality and her career accomplishments. </p>
    <h3>The Homepage</h3>
    <p>The simplicity of this project meant most information could be included on the homepage, opting for the ease of scrolling over clicking through to multiple pages. The client's most relevant work is featured on the homepage, with the option to click through to internal pages, where the user can read more about the client's accomplishments in each role.</p>
