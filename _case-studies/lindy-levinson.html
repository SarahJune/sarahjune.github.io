    <h3>The Project</h3>
    <p><a href="https://lindylevinson.com/" target="_blank">Lindylevinson.com</a> is a professional website for the Director of Admissions at a coding academy in Seattle, WA. The client wanted a personalized platform where she could highlight her past work experience and feature contact information so that people within and outside of her network could get in touch with her.</p>
    <h3>My Role</h3>
    <p>I developed and delivered a website that fits the client's personal asthetic and professional brand. The outcome was a cohesive online presence that represents both her personality and her career accomplishments.</p>
    <h3>Research</h3>
    <p>During the initial research and planning for this project, I sat down with the client to map out what content she wanted to include on her website and what visual styles appealed to her. I also researched personal sites of other professionals to brainstorm the information architecture.</p>

    <figcaption><strong>The Homepage: </strong>The simplicity of this project meant most information could be included on the homepage, opting for the ease of scrolling over clicking through to multiple pages. The client's most relevant work is featured on the homepage, with the option to click through to internal pages, where the user can read more about the client's accomplishments in each role.</figcaption>

    <h3>UX Design</h3>
    <p>The straightforward content of the website translated to a straightforward design, achieved by including most information on the homepage, with individual pages for the three primary roles the client wanted to highlight.</p>

    <h3>Visual Design</h3>
    <p>The visual design of this project reflects the client's personal style. I chose a light, feminine color palette and minimalist layout while including imagery that nods to the client's love of travel and points in her professional career.</p>
    <p>The font, which plays a major role in the overall design and aesthetic of the website, is Josefin Sans, described by the creator as "geometric, elegant, with a vintage feeling," which matches the overall aesthetic of the final design of the site.</p>
