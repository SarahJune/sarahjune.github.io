Today, I'm going to share with you six rules I've learned in my career as a designer.

While these rules can be broken by experienced designers without breaking the design, that's not who these guidelines are for. This post is focused on visual design, intended for people who are new to design and need some guidelines when starting out on a new project. My original intended audience was new developers who need to add some finesse to their projects or website, but anyone who is new to design will benefit from the guidelines in this article.

I've noticed that a lot of new developers are often intimidated at the prospect of making design decisions while also trying to learn CSS. While developers in the real world are given specs and prototypes to work from, knowing basic design techniques and resources is invaluable. Having at least some guidelines for producing good visual design will come in handy, especially as new devs build their own websites and portfolio to catch the eye of a hiring manager.

So let's dive in!

### 1. Whitespace is Your Friend

<a href="http://erikdkennedy.com/" target="_blank">Erik Kennedy's</a> advice to "double your whitespace" is spot on. In this era of clean design and spacious layout, you are much more likely to have too little whitespace than too much. This applies to both font spacing and overall layout.

#### Font
The space between lines of type is called `line height` in code and `leading` (pronounced "ledding") in design. The default is often 1.2 times the height of the type, so 20pt font has a 24px line height. This is a good rule of thumb when you're specifying styles in CSS for text styles, but I find it's often not enough. My go-to is 1.5 to 2 times the font size. For context, the type you're reading is a 20px font with a 40px line height.

#### Layout
To demonstrate the importance of whitespace in layout, here's a (fictitious) company that sells wind turbines. This is a pretty standard website layout and the design could use some attention to detail in other ways, but it feels especially cramped and the elements are in desperate need of breathing room.
<figure class="fullwidth">
  <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/blogimages/windustries-before.png" alt="Keep Your Eye on the Ball">
  <figcaption>Minimal whitespace. The 1908 date is just a wee bit of humor.</figcaption>
</figure>

I added white space in the header, in between the nav links, around the text over the image, in the three-column layout, and in the following section. With just those changes, the page is already looking much better.

<figure class="fullwidth">
  <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/blogimages/windustries-after.png" alt="Keep Your Eye on the Ball">
  <figcaption>Ahhh, so much better.</figcaption>
</figure>

### 2. Pick a Solid Font

#### Variations
#### Readability
#### License
#### Style
#### Conventions

### 3. Be a (Color) Minimalist

It's really easy to overdue color in a design, or to mix saturated and desaturated tones if you're not careful.

#### Do:
1. Start with black and white
2. Pick a primary / secondary color
3. Use shades of gray

#### Donâ€™t (at first):
1. Use colored text
2. Use too many colors (less is more)

### 4. Nix Lines and Borders

### 5. Use High-Quality Images

### 6. Leverage Icons
