I studied visual communications as my minor in college, but I didn't really start digging in to the world of design until about three years ago, when a friend recommended I check out the field of UX design. Since then, I've been curating a list of resources I regularly return to, sometimes to re-familiarize myself with a topic, and sometimes to check out the new content my favorite designers have published.

As I added resources to this post, I was tempted to include some that I haven't gotten all the way through but that *seem* to have a lot of great information. But I decided to include **only the resources that actively helped me become a better designer.** These are the resources that, months or years after learning from them, I still remember (and benefit from) what I learned, and return to them on a regular basis. In my experience, the articles that boast "The 100 best design tutorials" are overwhelming. I want to be specific in this post, and only include resources I can vouch for myself.

Another note about the resources below: They're 100% free (or accessible through your local library). I definitely think that, as you dig more into design, you should support fellow designers and publishers who are publishing courses, books, and resources to help their peers. However, if you're just exploring, then there are plenty of free resources to get you started. Once you're in it a little more, you'll be better equipped to recognize which resources are worth investing in.

I'll add more resources as I go (or perhaps publish resources for intermediate designers as a Part 2) but for now, these are the resources that helped me be more confident and skilled at my craft during my "beginner" years.

### Designers to Follow

Over the years, there have been specific designers I've always come back to. They are both skilled in their craft and great at explaining / demonstrating specific topics.

These designers share content and tips on a bunch of different platforms, so I encourage you to sign up for their newsletters, follow them on Twitter, and check out their blogs (which is what I've linked to below).

### Tutorials to Try

My first step in learning Adobe Creative Cloud tools was to learn how the actual individual tools (like the pen or gradient) worked. But there are so many more features in Photoshop and Illustrator tucked away in the menu. These tutorials helped me not only discover what's possible, but how to get there quickly.

This tutorial (which I followed almost two years ago) introduced me to some really helpful functionality in Photoshop that I'd never used before, and after learning the brushed metal effect, I made a replica of the <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/3262723-Thermostat" target="____blank">thermostat in my apartment</a>. (Side note: the explanation of Vector Masks in this article is poor. I just used a clipping mask for those portions instead.)

The helpful thing about this tutorial and the one above is that you're learning how to complete designs—instead of "here's how to do this one thing in X tool," they demonstrate how to get a professional polish to a complete design, whether that be an icon or a complete user interface.

* <a href=" " target="____blank">Every Tuesday</a>
This isn't a specific tutorial, but I've stumbled upon Every Tuesday videos so often in my search for "How to do X in Illustrator" that I just go straight there for Illustrator tutorials now. Definitely check out Teela's videos!
