I studied visual communications as my minor in college, but I didn't really start digging in to the world of design until about three years ago, when a friend recommended I check out the field of UX design. Since then, I've been curating a list of resources I regularly return to, sometimes to re-familiarize myself with a topic, and sometimes to check out the new content my favorite designers have published.

As I added resources to this post, I was tempted to include some that I haven't gotten all the way through but that *seem* to have a lot of great information. But I decided to include **only the resources that actively helped me become a better designer.** That means that, months or years after learning from them, I still think about the information I learned, or return to them on a regular basis. In my experience, the articles that boast "The 100 best design tutorials" are overwhelming and frankly, unhelpful. I want to be specific in this post, and only include resources I can vouch for myself.

Another note about the resources below: They're 100% free (or accessible through your local library). I definitely think that, as you dig more into design, you should support fellow designers and publishers who are putting their work out there. However, if you're just exploring, then there are plenty of free resources to get you started. Once you're in it a little more, you'll be better equipped to recognize which resources are worth investing in.

I'll add more resources as I go (or perhaps include resources for intermediate designers as a Part 2) but for now, these are the resources that helped me be more confident and skilled at my craft during my "beginner" years.

### Designers to Follow

Over the years, there have been specific designers I've always come back to. They are both skilled in their craft and great at explaining / demonstrating specific topics.

These designers share content and tips on a bunch of different platforms, so I encourage you to sign up for their newsletters, follow them on Twitter, and check out their blog.
