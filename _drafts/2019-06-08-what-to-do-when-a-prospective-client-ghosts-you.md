Today, I want to talk about something that's been on my mind for a few weeks now:

### What do you do when a prospective client ghosts you?

I don’t mean someone who mentioned at a networking event once that "We hire freelance [enter your profession here] from time to time" but hasn't responded to your LinkedIn connection request.

I’m talking about someone with whom you've had a least one (probably many) phone, email, or in-person conversations. They like your work, have a project that is right up your alley, and ask for a proposal. You spend hours on it and send it their way.

And then, nothing.

### A first-hand experience with professional ghosting
Recently, I'd been connected with a startup that needed help on a project that was in my exact repertoire. They were excited that I could design what they needed, plus help build the website, develop the copy for it, and round out their marketing material. This project was going to need a lot of support, which I was happy to provide.

They requested a proposal, which I spent around three to four hours* putting together.

*Since I'm still tweaking the content and layout of my proposal template, this may have taken a little bit longer than normal, but since every proposal I put together is specialized for the project, each one is still several hours of work. I think most clients don’t realize this, since it takes them only a few seconds to say, "Send me a proposal!"*

A week or so went by with no response, which was surprising since the client was so eager to get started on the project. I followed up, and still nothing.

I'd been working on other projects and decided to give the client the benefit of the doubt: they had probably thought they'd responded and hadn't. Communication was clearly going to be an issue on this project and since I’d already sent the customary follow-up email, I decided to count it as lost and move on.

Then I heard through the grapevine that, in a meeting with a peer of mine, the client openly admitted to never replying to my email because my pricing wasn't within their budget (a post on mitigating this issue coming soon).

I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t incredulous.

But this post is supposed to be about *what to do* when this happens.

### So what next? Move on (and perhaps thank your lucky stars, since you probably dodged a bullet)

Let's be honest: if someone is disrespectful enough to ghost you like this, they were very likely going to be difficult to work with. I know it's hard to be counting on that project only for it to disintegrate, but I'd much rather dedicate that time to pursuing better clients and better projects than to spend several months pulling my hair out because of poor communication, scope creep, or worst of all, a client who goes dark when it’s time to write that final check.

You're inevitably going to have clients who need more attention than others, but the more people you work with, the more you'll be able to spot any warning signs early on to prepare yourself, set early expectations with the client, or perhaps pass on the project all together.

**Plus, the only real missed opportunity is the one that you don’t learn from.**
