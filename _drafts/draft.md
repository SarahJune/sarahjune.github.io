Today, I want to talk about something that's been on my mind for a few weeks now:

### What do you do when a prospective client ghosts you?

I'm not talking about someone who mentioned at a networking event once that "We hire freelance [enter your profession here] from time to time" and hasn't responded to your LinkedIn connection request.

I mean someone who you've had a least one, probably many phone, email, or in-person conversations with. They like your work, have a project that is right up your alley, and ask for a proposal. You spend hours on it and send it their way.

And then, nothing.

Unfortunately, I've noticed this happens far too often. Recently, I'd been connected with a startup that needed the exact work I'd done for another client. They were excited that I could design what they needed, plus help build the website, develop the copy for it, and round out their marketing material.

The project lead requested a proposal*, which I spent around three to four hours* putting together.

*Since I'm still working on the content and layout of my proposal template, this may have taken a little bit longer than it will in the future, but since each proposal I put together is specialized for each project, they are still several hours of work. I think most people for whom it takes ten seconds to say, "Send me a proposal!" don't realize this part.*

A week or so went by with no response, which was surprising since the client was so eager to get started on the project. I followed up, and still heard nothing.

Several weeks went by with still no contact. I'd been working on other projects and decided to give the client the benefit of the doubt: they had probably thought they'd responded and hadn't. Communication was clearly going to be an issue on this project, so I'd decided to count it as lost and move on.

Then I heard through the grapevine that, in a meeting with a peer of mine, the client openly admitted to purposefully never replying to my email because my pricing wasn't within in their budget.

Huge facepalm.

This isn't the first time this has happened and unfortunately it is probably not the last.

But believe it or not, these are great learning opportunities, and I missed one important step that could have saved me time and frustration from the start. Here are three things I've learned from experiences like this that still make the experience worthwhile.

### The Main Lesson: You Probably Dodged A Bullet

Let's be honest: if someone is disrespectful enough to ghost you like this, they were very likely going to be hard to work with. I know it's hard to be counting on that project, and exciting to see things get to the proposal stage, but I'd much rather have the time to pursue better clients and better projects than be stuck pulling my hair out by bad communication and disrespect for my time.

You're inevitably going to have clients who need more attention than others, but the more people you work with, the more you'll be able to spot warning signs early on and at least prepare yourself—and set early expectations with the client—if not pass on the project all together.
