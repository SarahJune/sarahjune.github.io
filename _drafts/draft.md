Today, I want to talk about something that's been on my mind for a few weeks now:

### What do you do when a prospective client ghosts you?

I don’t mean someone who mentioned at a networking event once that "We hire freelance [enter your profession here] from time to time" but hasn't responded to your LinkedIn connection request.

I’m talking about someone with whom you've had a least one (probably many) phone, email, or in-person conversations. They like your work, have a project that is right up your alley, and ask for a proposal. You spend hours on it and send it their way.

And then, nothing.

### A first-hand experience with professional ghosting

Recently, I'd been connected with a startup that needed help on a project that was in my exact repertoire. They were excited that I could design what they needed, plus help build the website, develop the copy for it, and round out their marketing material. This project was going to need a lot of support, which I was happy to provide.

They requested a proposal, which I spent around three to four hours* putting together.

*Since I'm still tweaking the content and layout of my proposal template, this may have taken a little bit longer than normal, but since every proposal I put together is specialized for the project, each one is still several hours of work. I think most clients don’t realize this, since it takes them only a few seconds to say, "Send me a proposal!"*

A week or so went by with no response, which was surprising since the client was so eager to get started on the project. I followed up, and still nothing.

I'd been working on other projects and decided to give the client the benefit of the doubt: they had probably thought they'd responded and hadn't. Communication was clearly going to be an issue on this project and since I’d already sent the customary follow-up email, I decided to count it as lost and move on.

Then I heard through the grapevine that, in a meeting with a peer of mine, the client openly admitted to never replying to my email because my pricing wasn't within their budget (a post on mitigating this issue coming soon).

I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t incredulous.

But this post is supposed to be about *what to do* when this happens.

### So do you do?

As Henry Ford famously said, “The only real mistake is the one from which we learn nothing.”

In this situation, the only thing you really *can* do is learn from the experience to reduce the chance it’ll happen again. Here are three things I’ve learned from being professionally ghosted:

#### 1. Get a number up front

I knew to ask for a prospective client’s budget when discussing a project. But I hadn’t been firm about getting that number before sending over a proposal. When you are really excited about a project, it’s easy to jump into action when a client says, “Just keep it under a million dollars *wink* *wink* ” or to misinterpret their enthusiasm for a willingness to pay what it will take to bring the project to fruition.

Most clients, especially individuals or small business owners, don’t yet have a concept for the time it takes for you to create what they want. It’s no fault of theirs—they just haven’t had the experience to know what to expect.

It’ll save both of you some time if you discuss the project’s budget at the start. The client will better understand the value you provide, and you will know that they have actually spent some time considering what the project is worth to them.

#### 2. Think back to any red or yellow flags

You're inevitably going to have clients who need more attention than others, but the more people you work with, the more you'll be able to spot early warning signs.  

Here are just some examples of yellow flags I’ve experienced in the initial project conversation:
The client is late
The client goes way over the time set for the meeting (most likely because they can’t stay on topic)
The client does most of the talking (your initial meeting should be a conversation, not a monologue)
The client mentions having worked with overseas designers*

* *If you’re in the U.S., you’re competing with often very talented designers who have lower cost of living (and therefore, lower pricing) in other parts of the world. You bring value to the project that is worth paying for, but if your client mentions working with designers overseas, they’re going to be used to paying (and therefore, expect) lower rates. This isn’t a deal-breaker, but it’s something to be aware of.*

One or even two of these flags doesn’t mean the project won’t be a good one. But noticing these (and other) signs will help you better prepare for the project and set early expectations with the client. And if you come across too many, perhaps you should consider passing on the project all together.

#### 3. Let it go (you probably dodged a bullet)

Let's be honest: if someone is disrespectful enough to ghost you like this, they were very likely going to be difficult to work with. I know it's hard to be counting on that project only for it to disintegrate, but it’s much better to dedicate that time to pursuing better clients and better projects than to spend several months pulling your hair out because of poor communication, scope creep, or worst of all, a client who goes dark when it’s time to write that final check.

Do you have a story about being ghosted or more yellow flags to add to the list? Let's hear them! <a href="https://twitter.com/sarah_june12" target="____blank">Ping me on Twitter</a> if you can top my story with one of your own.
