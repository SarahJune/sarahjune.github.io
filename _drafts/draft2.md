Here's something I'm slightly ashamed to admit I've only recently figured out. If given the opportunity, Present Sarah will shove an insane amount of tasks and projects into one day and expect Future Sarah to get it all done. She will then be overwhelmed and frustrated with Past Sarah, not know where to start, do the easiest ones, and leave the rest for tomorrow.

When I was planning the transition from full-time job to freelancing, I knew I had to rethink my schedule to stay on top of projects *and* not give myself an ulcer.

While I lived according to Asana at my job, I wasn't finding the same value when I used it for personal projects. Time blocking was out too, dismissed as too inflexible.

### Exit Stage Left: Micro-Stressors

To be honest, I was in denial about my poor task management. I've always been organized! Things were getting done! I didn't need a new system!

The problem wasn't that balls were getting dropped. The problem was the slightly elevated stress levels every time I'd look at my to-do list.

If I was going succeed as a freelancer (a career path typically compared to amusement park rides with titles like "The Fury" and "Steel Vengeance"), that little spike in my blood pressure had to go.

One wonderful thing about being a freelancer is that I think you get trained to watch for providence (or luck or happy coincidences or whatever you want to call it) more than in a full-time job. It seems like a project or tool or resource comes along at just the right time.

In this case, two important pieces came together that were vital to proper weekly planning. The first was gold-edged, spiral bound, and adorned with *2019* on the cover—a yearly planner from my sister for Christmas.

The second important piece was an introduction to <a href="https://bulletjournal.com/" target="____blank">bullet journaling</a>. The introduction taught me enough to incorporate the technique's main tenets.

The beauty of combining these two techniques was that I could plan out my weeks and still have a way to denote and move around tasks and appointments as necessary. I could see every day in a specific week, and each day only had room for 10 tasks, appointments, or reminders.

The best part of all was that when the day's tasks were checked off, I was *done*. No more feeling like I *should* be doing more. I could work ahead, or I could rest knowing that everything I needed to get done had a proper time block.

Planners and bullet journals aren't for everyone. But if you're struggling with too many to-dos and not enough productivity, I highly recommend getting some sort of physical representation of your time—whether a calendar or planner or some other method—and writing out your tasks. Then when you're done for the day, _be done_. Go on a walk, chill with a book, or call a friend.

Your sanity will thank you.
