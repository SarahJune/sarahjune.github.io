I've been ruminating on the content I want to share on this blog. Part of me is tempted to wait until I have "more" experience (an arbitrary goal since one can always get more experience), but I really want to pull back the curtain on the process of learning to freelance, and help someone learn from my mistakes along the way.

Today, I want to talk about something that's been on my mind for a few weeks now:

### What do you do when a prospective client ghosts you?

I'm not talking about someone who mentioned at a networking event once that "Oh we hire freelance ____ from time to time" and hasn't responded to your LinkedIn connection request.

I'm talking about someone who you've had a least one, probably many phone, email, or in person conversations with. They like your work, have a project that is right up your alley, and ask for a proposal. You spend hours on it, and send it their way.

And then, nothing.

Unfortunately, this happens far too often. Recently, I'd been connected with a startup that needed the exact work I'd done for another client. They were excited that I could design what they needed, help build their website, develop the copy for it, and round out their marketing material.

The project lead requested a proposal*, which I spent probably 3-4 hours putting together.

*Since I'm still working on the content and layout of my proposal template, this may have taken a little bit longer than it will in the future, but since each proposal I put together is specialized for each project, they are still several hours of work. I think most people for whom it takes ten seconds to say, "Send me a proposal!" don't realize this part.*

A week or so went by with no response, which was surprising since the client was so eager to get started on the project. I followed up, and still heard nothing.

Several weeks went by with still no contact. I'd been working on other projects and decided to give the client the benefit of the doubt: they had probably thought they'd responded and hadn't. Communication was clearly going to be an issue on this project, so I'd decided to count it as lost and move on.

Then I heard through the grapevine that, in a meeting with a peer of mine, the client openly admitted to purposefully never replying to my email because my pricing wasn't within in their budget.

Huge facepalm.

This isn't the first time this has happened and unfortunately it is probably not the last.

But believe it or not, these are great learning opportunities, and I missed one important step that could have saved me time and frustration from the start. Here are three things I've learned from experiences like this that still make the experience worthwhile.

### Lesson #1: You Probably Dodged A Bullet

Let's be honest: if someone is disrespectful enough to ghost you like this, they were very likely going to be hard to work with. I know it's hard to be counting on that project, and exciting to see things get to the proposal stage, but I'd much rather have the time to pursue better clients and better projects than be stuck pulling my hair out by bad communication and disrespect for my time.

You're inevitably going to have clients who need more attention than others, but the more people you work with, the more you'll be able to spot warning signs early on and at least prepare yourself—and set early expectations with the client—if not pass on the project all together.

### Lesson #2: Get a Number Up Front

My big mistake was not insisting on knowing what number the client had in mind for the project.

In my initial conversations with prospective clients, I always ask what their budget is for the project. But I discovered pretty early on that clients prefer you to do the work and then they can take or pass on the project.

Like I mentioned earlier, I really think people just don't realize A) how much time and effort goes into a design project, whether it's a logo or a full website, and B) how much time it takes to put together a proposal.

Now, I am very up front with cost before going too far down the road with a client. I won't even send a proposal unless I know that they've thought about budget and know how much they're willing to spend. I'm going to write a longer post about this soon, but for now, the takeaway is to know that the client has at least thought about price. It shows how serious the are about the project, and how much they value the work that you do.

### Lesson #3: Grow from Every Experience

I was pretty annoyed at first, but it's always more beneficial to you to look at the learning opportunity, even for projects you don't land.

When clients ghost, I add some of our interactions (like being late to meetings, dominating the conversation, getting off topic a lot, etc.) to my "yellow flags" list. They don't always mean the client will be hard to work with, but it's helpful to be watching for those signs to tell which clients are going to be harder to work with, so you can prepare (and set some expectations early).

Thanks for reading! I sincerely hope that you don't have to deal with clients ghosting you, but hopefully if it happens, you will be able to see the positives, say, "Dodged that bullet!" and move on to create bad-ass designs for clients who respect your time and value your work.
