Today I want to talk about generosity in business—specifically when you're freelancing.

### But first, an anecdote...

I had a funny exchange with someone a few months back that has stuck in the back of my mind. Usually that means there's more processing to be done and a lesson to be learned and that more details will arrive that will "complete the story," in a sense. It's like a balance has been shifted, and someone else needs to even the scales again.

Anyway, before I get too philosophical, here is what happened.

Several months ago, an acquaintance was complaining on social media about a client advocating for using a low-budget printer—for printing flyers, business cards, trifolds, that sort of thing. I commented to ask why the printer was a poor option, and in the course of our (very brief) comment conversation, I asked what she suggested people use instead.

Her response?

"A businesswomen doesn't reveal her secrets."

Umm what? How is a public company a secret? I honestly don't know her reasoning behind not wanting to share more because that's all she would say. Was it because she didn't want her local printer to become too popular and crowded? Was it because she wanted to seem mysterious and knowledgeable but didn't have anything to back up her claim? The world will never know, but for the sake of this post, let's say the former*.

*Honestly if you can figure this out, please fill me in because the whole exchange left me v confused.)*

And honestly, she could have a very good reason for not sharing. But I walked away from the exchange confused as to why she'd complain about a problem (i.e. what she considered to be a low-quality printer) in a very public way without providing a better solution.

The situation stank of stinginess, but there was more to it than that.

Fast-forward to this week. I've been noticing the end of the year creeping up all nonchalantly like it isn't planning on hitting us over the head with 2020-themed party favors. I asked a few friends for some CPA references because I want to make sure my books are in order before the end of the year. A bookkeeper acquaintance and fellow small-business owner offered to <em>look at my books and offer advice. Just. Because.</em>

I walked away from our exchange feeling like another female business owner had my back.

* **Light bulb.** *

The lessons from these two stories hit like confetti from a party popper on New Years Eve.*

* *Can you tell I'm not ready for 2019 to be over?*

### Lesson #1: You are where you are because of generosity.

When you're freelancing, it's easy to feel the need to be stingy—you have to get scrappy and put in long hours, and sometimes it feels like there aren't enough projects to go around.

I think we often associate generosity with *losing* something. If you are generous, you're *giving something away,* which means you won't have it when *you* need it.

But here's the thing. I didn't get here on my own. I am where I am because a friend told me how to buy my first domain. Because an employer let me take company classes for free. Because people like <a href="http://erikdkennedy.com/" target="____blank">Erik Kennedy</a> share amazing, in-depth design tips for free. Because mentors gave their time and advice and encouragement.

People in my past have been generous because they decided helping others was worth more than closely guarding their "business secrets." And because of this, I can't be stingy in the future. No one is an island, and while it feels good to be able to claim you're "self-taught" or "self-made," I don't think anyone can truly make that claim.

### Lesson #2: Goodwill pays dividends

Between these two people, who do you think I'm more willing to want to help or send business to in the future? The person who gave 20-30 minutes of her time, or the person who opted to be stingy with her resources ("her" resources is even overstating it because let us recall that we're assuming it's a <em>public</em> company she wasn't willing to share).

People like helping people who have helped them. And some day, you're going to need help.

In his book, Do Over, Jon Acuff talks about developing a "Career Savings Account." It's a bank of people who, when you go through a career change, are in your corner and would love to help you—often because you've already helped them.

But a few words of warning...
First, people can tell when you're keeping score. Giving just to get something back is hardly generosity. So give of your time and talents and knowledge, trusting that it will come back around when you need it.

Second, be wise with your time and energy and resources. You know what your schedule and your emotional health can handle.

And third, it's okay to sent boundaries with sponges. If your gut is telling you that someone is taking advantage of your generosity, it will be *more* helpful to them to set some limits on what they can take from you. We all need to learn to fight against our own selfishness—even the person who is being stingy with *your* generosity.

### Lesson #3: Don't Go Alone

One of my favorite parables is the story of Stone Soup, where hungry travelers convince the village locals (through an ingenious, very sweet method—<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Soup" target="____blank">read it here</a> if you aren't familiar) to pool their vegetables and make a soup everyone can enjoy together.

The story obviously is a parable about the value of sharing.

Generosity connects. Selfishness isolates. Being new to an industry is hard. Being a freelancer is hard. Hustling is hard. Operating from a scarcity mindset translates to hoarding resources—wouldn't you rather join the community?

Innovation doesn't happen in a vacuum. Progress doesn't happen as a result of isolation.

Okay, time to get off my soapbox. I think you get the point—be generous with the people around you.
