I'm super excited to share the final product of <a href="https://www.rainierwatch.com/shop/accessories/stickers/rainier-watcher-badge-sticker/" target="____blank">my first design collaboration</a>!

For the past few months (in between the hectic process of moving, travel, wrapping up projects, and starting new ones), I've been working on a sticker design for Seattle-based <a href="https://www.rainierwatch.com/" target="____blank">Rainier Watch</a>, an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mtrainierwatch/" target="____blank">Instagram page</a> / shop / community focused on the beautiful Mount Rainier.

The design features a retro color palette and illustration of The Mountain (I especially loved working with color and font pairings for this project).

The best part of working with David and the rest of the team at Rainier Watch is that a percentage of every sale from their shop is donated to organizations dedicated to supporting Mount Rainier.

Pop over to their shop to <a href="https://www.rainierwatch.com/shop/accessories/stickers/rainier-watcher-badge-sticker/" target="____blank">get your own Rainier Watcher sticker</a>, plus check out more great designs from local designers on their site.

Huge thank you to David and Rainier Watch for the opportunity!
