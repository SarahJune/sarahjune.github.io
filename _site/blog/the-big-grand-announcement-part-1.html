    <p>“Tell me, what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life?” — <a href="https://www.habitsforwellbeing.com/what-will-you-do-with-your-one-wild-and-precious-life/" target="_blank">Mary Oliver</a></p>

<p>I have some news! (If you’re in a rush, get the <a href="#tldr">TL;DR</a> here.)</p>

<p>Ready?</p>

<p>I quit my job.</p>

<p><em>* Slightly panics *</em></p>

<p>To clarify, I quit my job without having <em>another</em> job. I’ll be honest, it’s not something I ever pictured myself doing. That would be <em>risky</em>. And aren’t risk-takers those people who climb to really high places and then yell, “YOLO!” as they jump off? For <em>fun</em>?</p>

<p>Hard pass.</p>

<p>Actually, it turns out that—according to <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/risk-taker" target="_blank">Merriam-Webster</a>—”risk-takers” are people who are “willing to do things that involve danger or risk in order to achieve a goal.”</p>

<p>Setting and achieving a goal? Now <em>that</em> I can get behind.</p>

<h3 id="so-whats-the-goal">So… What’s the goal?</h3>
<p>The purpose of this change is to blend the life I want to live with the work I love to do: designing <em>really</em> cool things while traveling to interesting places. This means focusing my career solely on design (instead of the mix of design and content creation I was doing before) and pursuing work that is location-independent.</p>

<p>But I didn’t feel I could properly make this change while still in a full-time job. There was a lot of time-intensive work ahead: redesigning my website (tada!), studying all of the tutorials and resources I’d been amassing, and seeking out roles that more closely align with my new goals.</p>

<p>So I decided to do something risky: quit.</p>

<p>Of course, this decision didn’t come without a lot of prep and research. As I laid the groundwork, it was encouraging to see how many people and companies are building a culture to support completely distributed teams.</p>

<p>Writing about this change was another step I wanted to take (thanks for being a part of it!). Publicly shared goals can be very motivating, so here’s what I’ll be doing to turn this dream into a reality:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Pursue excellence in design</li>
  <li>Say yes to unexpected opportunities and new places</li>
  <li>Stretch the limits of my comfort zone</li>
  <li>Blog about what I’m learning through this process</li>
  <li>Add new design skills to my wheelhouse (like motion graphics!)</li>
</ol>

<p>I don’t know exactly what the outcome of this change will look like. There may be an opportunity just around the corner, or I may have years of freelancing ahead of me.</p>

<p>I do know that I’m looking forward to teaming up with some amazing people, traveling to new places, and producing designs that are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHHEcmZtJvY" target="_blank">really, really ridiculously good looking</a>.</p>

<h3 id="and-lastly-my-thank-you-speech">And lastly, my thank-you speech…</h3>
<p>I want to say thank you to everyone I’ve had the pleasure of working with over the past five years. During that time, I went from copy editing blog articles as an intern to overseeing all content creation: the website, print material, guides, blog posts, student interviews, advertising creative, email content… the list goes on, and I couldn’t have asked for a better place to grow. I wouldn’t be able to start the next phase of my career without the experience, confidence, and relationships that I gained in the last half decade.</p>

<p>I’m also so grateful to the <em>many</em> people who have been willing to answer my questions around freelancing, give design feedback, and share advice and encouragement. You know who you are and you have my sincerest gratitude.</p>

<h3 id="thats-it">That’s it!</h3>
<p>Thank you for making it to the end of The Big, Grand Announcement: Part 1*! You’re the best. 😘</p>

<p><em>*Part 2 coming soon. Until then, please enjoy The Best Gif of All Time:</em></p>

<h3 id="tldr">TL;DR:</h3>
<p>I quit my job as part designer, part jack-of-all-marketing-trades to focus my full energy on design. If you want to collaborate on a project (hire me!), <a href="mailto:sarah@sarahjunefischer.com">get in touch</a>.</p>
