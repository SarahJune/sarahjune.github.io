                <h3>Code Fellows | Website</h3>
                <p>As my company’s website/content manager turned UX designer, I’m constantly iterating on our website. In summer 2016, it was time for a revamp of the homepage, which meant diving into React code and putting my web coding skills to good use.</p>
                <figure class="img-center">
                <figcaption>The Final Product</figcaption>
                  <img src="../../img/new-homepage.png">
                </figure>
                <h4>Goals</h4>
                <p>The purpose of the website homepage is to introduce newcomers to Code Fellows’ immersive training program. It needs to tell our story and quickly answer the most common customer questions, from financing options to proof of student success.</p>
                <p>The overall goal was to restructure the homepage in a way that answers the most common customer questions and provides a clear picture of Code Fellows’ business.</p>
                <h4>Researching</h4>
                <p>I had some gut instincts on what content the homepage needed, which was sometimes confirmed, sometimes disproven in my research phase.</p>
                <figure class="img-left">
                <figcaption>Ye Olde Homepage</figcaption>
                  <img src="../../img/cs1-original-hp.png">
                </figure>
                <h4>Stakeholder Interviews</h4>
                <p>My primary stakeholder was the Admission department, since they are the ones responding to questions not answered well enough by the website. With only three people on that team, minimizing incoming questions is paramount. The key questions and what they unearthed were:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>What top questions are coming in through our website’s Contact Us form?<br />We were getting a lot of questions about how to get started, and if we had any options for federal aid.</li>
                  <li>What are the biggest reasons students weren’t finishing or even starting the application process?<br />Financing limitations were a huge cause of drop-off rates in applications.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Based on my conversations with Admissions, we needed to include a section for Financing & Scholarships and Code 101, our one-day introductory class for new coders.</p>
                <h4>Data & Analytics</h4>
                <p>Next, I dove into the data and Google Analytics’ In-Page Insights tool (now a Chrome plugin). This highlighted which pages customers navigated to after landing on the homepage, showing what should higher on the homepage and what could be closer to the bottom.</p>
                <p>Based on the top visited pages from the homepage, we needed to include more information around:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Stats and testimonials of our students’ success in the bootcamp and in the tech industry</li>
                  <li>Companies who have hired our graduates</li>
                </ol>

                  <img src="../../img/wireframe.png">
                </figure>
                <h4>Wireframing</h4>
                <p>I’m hopeful this is the only time in my career when I will use Google Spreadsheets (yep, you read that right) as a wireframing tool.</p>
                <p>While I realize that Google Spreadsheets isn’t the ideal tool to use for wireframing, it did provide two important aspects of the project:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>A wireframe! Something is better than nothing.</li>
                  <li>A place where sections could be reordered, added, deleted, resized, hyperlinked, etc.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>These were important when it came to prototyping.</p>
                <figure class="img-left">
                  <figcaption>Final prototype, demonstrating what top customer questions the homepage will answer.</figcaption>

                </figure>
                <h4>Prototyping</h4>
                <p>As chief designer and developer for this project, my designs were slightly limited by my coding skills. This kept the project from ballooning in scope (I had to stay within the bounds of my own coding ability) but also challenged me to improve my technical skill set.</p>
                <p>For prototyping this project, I started with a screenshot in Photoshop, cut it up into sections, and started reorganizing to see what I had to work with, and what I needed to build.</p>
                <p>After creating a prototype, I got sign-off from my boss to start building.</p>
                <h4>Building</h4>
                <p>Now came the fun part! My computer was set up with our development environment and I’m proficient at Git and our build tools, so I was off to the races.</p>
                <p>The best part about being both designer and developer on this project was that I could quickly iterate when I realized a specific design wasn’t going to work. Because of this, I support developers being involved in the design process and vice versa, so that:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>They can get an early heads up on any more complicated technical challenges ahead.</li>
                  <li>The design team can know the viability of their ideas.</li>
                  <li>Designs can be iterated on if necessary, rather than shoe-horning a design into place even if it no longer makes sense.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>One example of the tech not supporting the design was when I realized the limitations for sliders in our current system. I wanted to have rectangular partner logos stacked, and square logos on their own, to achieve a clean grid:</p>
                <figure class="img-center">
                <figcaption>Prototype</figcaption>
                  <img src="../../img/slider-prototype.png">
                </figure>
                <p>This ended up being harder to implement than I thought, and I had to settle for single-file logos (and am about ready to nix the sliders entirely—more on this later):</p>
                <figure class="img-center">
                <figcaption>Final</figcaption>
                  <img src="../../img/slider-final.png">
                </figure>
                <p>One example of iterating on the design later in the process was moving the Learn More link in the Stats section:</p>
                <figure class="img-center">
                  <figcaption>Prototype</figcaption>
                  <img src="../../img/stats-prototype.png">
                </figure>
                <p>Instead of below the section, which made it feel like it was floating, I moved the link to be beside the subject heading. That simple change (plus more whitespace) cleans up the section:</p>
                <figure class="img-center">
                  <figcaption>Final</figcaption>
                  <img src="../../img/stats-final.png">
                </figure>
                <h4>Testing</h4>
                <p>I also got to play QA for this project, testing the new homepage in various window widths, devices, and browsers. This helped to highlight unforeseen issues, such as the button width on mobile screens. My quick check for mobile styles as I’m coding is to size the desktop browser window as small as possible. Chrome (my browser of choice) reduces to 400px wide, while Firefox goes all the way down to 355px. At 400px, the buttons in the financing section looked great, but going down just 45px revealed some margin and sizing issues. I have enough CSS experience to know how to account and prepare for various screen sizes, but there’s always at least one unexpected behavior that takes me back to the code.</p>
                <h4>Launching & Iterating</h4>
                <p>We launched the new homepage at the end of September 2016. The version we launched (seen on the next page) is pretty close to the prototype and still reflects the overall brand, but is much cleaner and more informative to first-time visitors.</p>
                <p>While the homepage was definitely improved during this project, Iím still iterating. One change we made recently was to feature upcoming intro workshops above the fold because of a recent marketing campaign. The registration page for the workshops needed to be a lot easier for users to find, which is why we updated the hero section with a button that leads straight to the event to register.</p>
                <h4>Next Steps</h4>
                <p>The next step is to replace the large text-heavy section near the bottom of the homepage with a graphic that better explains the flow of our program.</p>
                <p>And like I mentioned above, I’m hoping to remove the slider of hiring companies and replace it with a clean, more scannable grid of logos.</p>
                <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                <p>Overall, this project was a great chance to practice the UX design process and improve the experience of our first-time site users.</p>
