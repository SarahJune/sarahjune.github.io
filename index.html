      <p>I'm glad you're here. I'm Sarah, a designer and writer based in the Pacific Northwest. I believe in the power of good designâ€”<strong>together, we can make the web a better place.</strong></p>
      <p>When I'm not pursuing my craft, I can probably be found treasure hunting at thrift stores, enriching my world with audiobooks, or figuring out how to get some CSS styling <em>just</em> right.</p>
      <p><strong>Take a look around!</strong> You can see examples of my <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/designs">designs here</a>, and read what I'm up to on my <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog">blog</a>. If you want to collaborate on a project (or just grab coffee and swap reading lists), <a href="mailto:sarah@sarahjunefischer.com">get in touch.</a></p>
